An extension to display Reddit threads for YouTube and Nebula videos.

This is loosely based on [Lucien Maloney's extension](https://github.com/lucienmaloney/reddit_comments_for_youtube_extension) (it was once a fork, but has since been totally rewritten twice).

Supports:

- Displaying threads
- Blacklisting subreddits
- Voting
- Commenting

Interactive elements will be stripped if:

- The extension cannot access Reddit cookies
- The user is logged out
- The user is suspended
- The thread is archived
- The thread or comment chain is locked
